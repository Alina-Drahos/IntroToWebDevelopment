    <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
    <P>I am thirty years old and have a degree in Mechanical Engineering. However, after studying Java and C# on my own, I decided to become a Software Engineer.</P>
    <P>It is extremly fullfilling to find the solution to a herculian problem, and be able to learn from it and reapply the knowledge to new projects.</p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
    <p>My last job, contracting for CenturyLink, consited of utilizing computer systems to draw permit requests and prints that guided Splicers and Technicans to install Telecommunication equipment.</p>
    <P>Besides the eduction that I received in the Software Guild, I also aquired a Microsoft Technolgy Associate Certification.</p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <p>I love spending time with my two cats, Atticus and Samantha, as well as enjoying all of Minnesota's four seasons outdoors </p>
    <p>Ocassionaly, I volunteer at animal sanctuaries and help out with cleaning, feeding our grooming all of the fury residents.
